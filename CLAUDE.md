A Next.js fashion app.

## Guidelines

- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile screens first, then scale up. All components must be responsive.
- **Theming**: Customizability is a priority. Use CSS variables for colors, spacing, and typography. Make themes easy to swap and extend.
- **Testing**: If the code is to be reused in many places, then a unit test is must.
- **Localization**: All user-facing text must be internationalized. Use translation keys instead of hardcoded strings. Support RTL layouts for languages like Arabic and Hebrew.
